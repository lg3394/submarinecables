# Submarine Cable Data Exploration

**Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze and visualize the growth of submarine cables built over the past 15 years (2010â€“2024). The goal was to retrieve data on the number of submarine cables becoming operational each year, visualize it using Datawrapper, and create a simple website to present these findings. This project also serves as an entry point into deeper research on submarine cable ownership, distribution, and geopolitical implications.

**Tools & Packages Used**

- Python for data retrieval and processing

- Requests to fetch data from the API

- Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation

- Datawrapper for interactive visualizations

- HTML & CSS to build a basic website for presentation

**Data Collection**

The primary data source was a hidden API powering the Submarine Cable Map. By directly querying API endpoints, I was able to extract cable data for each year, normalize it, and prepare it for visualization.

**Future Development & Research**

- More hidden APIs

- Geographic distributions

- Ownership and control

This is the beginning of a project that looks into the geopolitical, technological and corporate implications of submarine cables. Any contributions or ideas for further investigation are welcome.
